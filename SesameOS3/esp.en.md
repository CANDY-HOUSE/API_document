#### Example of ESP32-C3-DevKitM-1 and Sesame5 Switch Control

This project demonstrates how to use the ESP32-C3-DevKitM-1 microcontroller to register and control Sesame5 smart lock. The example uses the ESP-IDF development framework to automatically find, connect, and register nearby Sesame5 devices using BLE technology. When the ESP32-C3-DevKitM-1 detects that the Sesame5 has reached the unlock position, it will send an instruction to automatically lock.

### Installation and Environmental Setting

1. Please ensure that you have installed the toolchain through ESP-IDF's `install.sh`.
2. Open the terminal, navigate to the path of ESP-IDF, and execute `export.sh` to add environmental variables.
3. Connect the ESP32-C3-DevKitM-1 to your computer via USB.
4. Return to the project folder and run `idf.py flash` to compile and burn.

Usage: After burning and rebooting the ESP32-C3-DevKitM-1, it will automatically search for unregistered Sesame devices nearby. After connecting and registering, the ESP32-C3-DevKitM-1 will monitor the status of the Sesame5 and send a lock command at the appropriate time.
